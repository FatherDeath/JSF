# JeuxSansFrontières 
**Jeux Sans Frontières** is set in a world in which World War One was fought all the way up to the 2050s. It is set in a similar world artistically to Pre-War Fallout or Bioshock's Rapture, filled to the brim with retro-futurism and art-deco influences. 


The mod's start-date is 2069, in the middle of peace-time and involves three main factions butting heads; Internationalist Russia, Death-Cult China and America.
