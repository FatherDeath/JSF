 FIN_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "Military Rifle M/39, nicknamed 'Ukko-Pekka' after the former President Pehr Evind Svinhufvud, the rifle was designed as a compromise between the Army and White Guard, adopted so as to standardize the Finnish Mosin–Nagant production. The M/39 was derived largely from the M28-30, but included some alterations proposed by the Army. The M/39 also incorporated a semi-pistol grip into the stock, though some early examples used typical Mosin–Nagant straight stocks. Only 10 rifles were completed by the end of the Winter War, but 96,800 were produced after the Winter War and used in the Continuation War. Small numbers were also assembled from leftover parts in the late 1960s through 1970."

In addition, its development came with a variety of attachments including a rubber padded stock. The AK74’s improvements allowed soldiers to carry a greater amount of ammunition in the field and maintain a higher volume of fire at higher mid range accuracies. It saw expensive usage during the Afghanistan conflict where the CIA paid the Mujahideen a great sum of money to retrieve a captured AK74."

The SG-43 used a tilting breechblock and came with an apparatus on the bottom that allowed to to be mounted on tripods, wheeled mounts, or on vehicles as a support weapon. The barrel is air-cooled and very dense making it difficult to cool in most temperatures but comes with a chromium-plated bore that can sustain them. This makes it unreliable in higher temperatures. It saw heavy usage around the end of WWII. It has been licensed to vast numbers of countries resulting it it seeing combat in the Korean and Vietnam wars. Although the weapon itself also has a track record of being involved in many, many civil wars.\nThe M1938 mortar is a 120mm soviet mortar used heavily by the Soviet army during WWII. Its design is a near-copy of the French Mortier Brandt de 120mm. The mortar itself is very easy to limber and unlimber and could move around quickly to avoid counter fire.

The gun itself was eventually taken out of infantry service in the mid 1960s for its immense weight and replaced with an alternate HMG. It is notorious for its exceptional 3000 meter horizontal range and 2000 aerial range. Its heavy caliber could also make it useful a light-anti armor weapon and was placed on scout cars and BTRs. It saw usage during the Korean and Vietnam war and its hand down leasing has led these weapons to see combat in many different wars. Even today, the gun itself has not yet been taken out of service and has seen modern conflicts such as the Gulf and Iraq wars.\nThe 120-PM-43 mortar was a 120mm muzzle loaded breech Soviet mortar developed in 1943 and was a modified version of the M1938.
