 USA_supremacism_party_long:0 "Davis Party - Breckinridge Militia                             §gWhile it is widely known that the Davis Party is a collective of reactionary neo-confederates, the Breckinridge Militia makes them look progressive, if not egalitarian in nature. Marshal's involvement in the Davis Party split the movement, and his position as the Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan, gave him the political power to create an esoteric conglomerate of the most vitriolic and radical elements of the right in the 'Divided States of Weimerica' - as Pascal puts it. However, Pascal's plans are not necessarily in line with his zealous comrades, his time in Cambodia has given him an appreciation against his enemy, Visna, the totalitarian socialist who lead Cambodia with an iron-fist during the U.S Intervention, inspired Pascal deeply with the use of human-wave tactics and the loyal devotion to his personality. Pascal's economic policies are inherently socialist in nature, but the people are too dumb to see it. His social policies can be seen in his home-state of Louisiana, his proto-supremacist state; the Breckinridge Militia has taken up the white man's burden and the bodies are going to be piling up.§!"
